|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Most of people think my story is a little bit simple, should delve deeper into the weather story| I'll delve deeper into the dataset and other data I can find to make the story more meaningful |
| People mentioned all my visualizations are not large enough.| Due to the template, I cannot adjust the size of visualization, so I'd like to change a template.  |
| People metion my texts are not that obvious to see. Some text colors are too close to the background.| I'll change the text color or background.                                                |
|                                          |                                                                                 |


Overeall, I think the most important thing I need to do is to add more aspects and details into story, making the story more interesting and meaningful.
