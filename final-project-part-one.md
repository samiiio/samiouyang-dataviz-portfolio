# Outline
Since moving to Pittsburgh a year ago, I’ve often heard people say, “It rains all the time here!” But after experiencing the city’s weather by myself, it doesn’t seem as rainy as I expected. Is this just my perception, or is Pittsburgh’s reputation for constant rain exaggerated? To find out, I’ll analyze historical weather data to uncover the true patterns of rainy and snowy days, identify the most frequent rainy seasons, and see if Pittsburgh really lives up to its rainy reputation.

This project investigates Pittsburgh’s weather patterns, focusing on precipitation trends, including the number of rainy and snowy days, seasonal variations, and the most frequent rainy periods. By analyzing historical weather data, we can identify patterns in rainfall and snowfall distribution, helping to understand climate trends in the region. 


## Initial sketches

I'll first exploring the percentage of each weather condition in Pittsburgh, to see if rainy days really dominiate a lot in Pittsburgh.

Then I will figure out when is the rainy season in Pittsburgh.


# The data

The data is from Visual Crossing Weather, a convienet and lowest-cost source for historical weather data.(Visual Crossing, 2024) The data contains features like temperature, perciptation, humidity, windspeed, etc. So I will explore:
- the percentage of rainy days in a year in pittsburgh
- when is the rainy season
- when is the best time for playing tennis outdoor
- etc.


# Method and medium
I will first use python to see if there any missing values or ourliers I need to handle. After data cleaning, I will use Tableau or Python to explore data, to see what interesting data visualizations I can make, and also to achieve the inital sketches I made above.
For the presentation, I would like to use Shorthand to do that.
