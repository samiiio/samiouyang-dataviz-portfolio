# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi!  I'm Sami. I'm studying data analytics and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. I really like data.  And I like visualizations.  So I guess you can say that I like data visualizations!

# What I hope to learn

From this course, I have several learning goals:
1. Making beautiful data visualizations.
2. Creating effective and informative data visualizations.
3. Telling good stories with data visualizations.

Once I graduate, I would like to be a Data Analyst or Business Analyst, or having my own coffee shop!
