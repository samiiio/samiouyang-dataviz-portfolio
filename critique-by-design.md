# Redesign HPV Vaccine Coverage Visualization

In this assignment, I'm going to critique a visualization by redesign it. I'll include my every step and insights in this page.

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

The reason I choose this visualization is because I actually think this visualilzation is very straightforward to understand, and efficient to convey information. But the design is not beautiful, the audience may lost interest or do not want to spend time reading it. So even though I know it would be challenging to make the visualization convey information more efficiently than the orginal one, I would still like to see if I can make this visualization looks better. 

## Step two: the critique

There are few areas of possible improvements for this visualization:
- the whole visualization looks boring, it lacks of color differentiation. Although the it's not necessary in this case to use multiple colors, but I think we can use colors to make the visualization look better.
- the background and y-axis and x-axis labels are too light and subtle, making it difficult for audience to know the exact values.
- there's no sequence or order of all the countries, so it is hard to compare the total 12 countries' coverage on HPV vaccine.
- there are some missing labels (years) on x-axis. 

## Step three: Sketch a solution

The reason I choose the heatmap is it can shows the vaccine coverage of each year in our selected countries. It is hard for audience to read the exact rates from the orignal visualization, but in this heatmap, everything is straightforward. Audiences could learn information without effort.

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| describe to me what this is telling you?| A visualization showing HPV vaccine condition of different countires  | HPV vaccine coverage condition worldwild |
|Which sketch do you prefer?|    Treemap       |     Heatmap        |
|  Is there anything you would change? |             |  Colorplatte of heatmap           |

Synthesis: 

It seems like both interviewees think I can choose a better color platte for no matter which sketch. And both of them think there might be a place to change the chart type, but we did not come up with any. I might try to change a chart type later.

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._

The reason I choose stacked area chart is:
- It can shows the upward trend of HPV vaccine coverage of different countries over time. While in the original visualization, it is not that obvious to see the overall upward trends of vaccine coverage.
- It can shows the ranking of vaccine coverage conditions of selected countries, therefore it would be easier for audiences to compare.
- The visualization is beautiful, which could attract audiences' attention.
