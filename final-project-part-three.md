# The final data story
> Include a link to your final data story on Shorthand, Esri StoryMaps, etc. here. 

Shorthand:

[Surviving in Pittsburg's Rainy Weather](https://preview.shorthand.com/WNG4GWnGZbeSOepV)

# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

From Part II, I have made lots of changes:
- I have added a map showing the average precipitation of neighborhoods near CMU campus.
- I have added a horizontal multiple bar charts to show the 2024 rainiest city ranking in US.
- I have revised the title and annotation on previous graphs to make them more readable.
- I have change the background and text colors because my interviees said they were not easy to read.
- I have also adjust the size of charts to make them more easy to read.
- I have revise the paragraph under each chart, making more explanations.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

My audience would be primarily three groups:
1. Incoming students to Pittsburgh
   This group would like to learn more about Pittsburgh's weather to learn the future life; and can also choose future housing areas for comparatively less rainy experience.
2. Outdoor activities lovers in Pittsburgh
   Learning more Pittsburgh weather patterns could help outdoor activities lovers to make the most of Pittsburgh's rainy weather to enjoy outdoor activities.
