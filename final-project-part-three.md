# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

From Part II, I have made lots of changes:
- I have added a map showing the average precipitation of neighborhoods near CMU campus.
- I have added a horizontal multiple bar charts to show the 2024 rainiest city ranking in US.
- I have revised the title and annotation on previous graphs to make them more readable.
- I have change the background and text colors because my interviees said they were not easy to read.
- I have also adjust the size of charts to make them more easy to read.
- I have revise the paragraph under each chart, making more explanations.

## The audience

My audience would be primarily three groups:
- Newcomers & Incoming students in Pittsburgh
They might not be familiar with the cityâ€™s weather and need tips on housing, outdoor activities, and seasonal planning.
- Outdoor Enthusiasts & Fitness Lovers in Pittsburgh
The weather can impact when and where they can train or play sports.

I really like my topic about Pittsburgh's rainy weather. If I have more time, I would add some parts:
- I would like to use map to visualize the annual precipitation or annual rainy days of each city in US, the map should be better than the horizontal bar chart ranking list, and it should be more intersting to read.
- I can explore the city around pittsburgh, figuring out those cities have comparatively lower precipitation, and we can combine these with the recommendations, to provide plans for audience to 'escape' from pittsburgh in rainy season.
- I would also focus on the history of pittsburgh's rain. Like is there any geographical changes caused by rain. I tried to find this data this time, but I cannot find any. If I have more time, I can delve deeper into this part.
