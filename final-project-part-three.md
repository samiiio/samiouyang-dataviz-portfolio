# The final data story

[Surviving in Pittsburg's Rainy Weather](https://preview.shorthand.com/WNG4GWnGZbeSOepV)

# Changes made since Part II

From Part II, I have made lots of changes:
- I have added a map showing the average precipitation of neighborhoods near CMU campus.
  - I make this change because one of my target audience is incoming students group. Learning the average precipitation of neighborhoods could help them make choice on housing. And it would be fun to see the difference on precipitation within Pittsburgh. Personally speaking, I did not expect that the precipitation difference would be this large.
- I have added a horizontal multiple bar charts to show the 2024 rainiest city ranking in US.
  - To give audience a better idea about the top rainiest city, I visualize the rainy days and precipitation, so audience can easily compare by seeing the bar charts.I also highlight the bars of Pittsburgh, to make it more obvious to see.
- I have revised the title and annotation on previous graphs to make them more readable.
  - My interviees from part II give me some suggestions that I should use better titles for graphs, making them more summarizable.
- I have change the background and text colors, and adjust the size of charts.
  - According to my interviees, the charts are too small to see, and the background's color is close to the map, so they cannot see the map very clearly. SO I change the opacity and the background color to make the map more readable.
- I have revise the paragraph under each chart, making more explanations.


## The audience

My audience would be primarily three groups:
- Newcomers & Incoming students in Pittsburgh
They might not be familiar with the cityâ€™s weather and need tips on housing, outdoor activities, and seasonal planning.
- Outdoor Enthusiasts & Fitness Lovers in Pittsburgh
The weather can impact when and where they can train or play sports.

I really like my topic about Pittsburgh's rainy weather. If I have more time, I would add some parts:
- I would like to use map to visualize the annual precipitation or annual rainy days of each city in US, the map should be better than the horizontal bar chart ranking list, and it should be more intersting to read.
- I can explore the city around pittsburgh, figuring out those cities have comparatively lower precipitation, and we can combine these with the recommendations, to provide plans for audience to 'escape' from pittsburgh in rainy season.
- I would also focus on the history of pittsburgh's rain. Like is there any geographical changes caused by rain. I tried to find this data this time, but I cannot find any. If I have more time, I can delve deeper into this part.
