# Outline
Since moving to Pittsburgh a year ago, I’ve often heard people say, “It rains all the time here!” But after experiencing the city’s weather by myself, it doesn’t seem as rainy as I expected. Is this just my perception, or is Pittsburgh’s reputation for constant rain exaggerated? To find out, I’ll analyze historical weather data to uncover the true patterns of rainy and snowy days, identify the most frequent rainy seasons, and see if Pittsburgh really lives up to its rainy reputation.

This project investigates Pittsburgh’s weather patterns, focusing on precipitation trends, including the number of rainy and snowy days, seasonal variations, and the most frequent rainy periods. By analyzing historical weather data, we can identify patterns in rainfall and snowfall distribution, helping to understand climate trends in the region.
